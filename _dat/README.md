* [Gowella](https://www.yongliu.org/datasets/)\
Gowalla was a worldwide location-based social network where users can check in at POIs. The dataset was collected from 2010 to 2011, including users’ check-in history. We only consider those users with at least 15 POI check-ins. The final preprocessed dataset contains 18,737 users and 1,666,455 check-ins in total. [1]

* [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)\
For the Yelp dataset, we only consider those users that have at least 15 check-in records. The pre-processed data contains 718,214 check-ins from 17,534 users in 7,757 businesses. For both datasets, we set the month in a year as the time dimension. Likewise, we use the check-in as positive entries Ω+ and sample the same number of entries for the set of negative entries Ω−.[1]
